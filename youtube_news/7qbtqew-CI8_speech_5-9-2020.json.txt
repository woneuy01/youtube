Well, I feel about vaccines like I feel about test. This is gonna go away without a vaccine. It's going to go away, and it's we're not going to see it again. Hopefully, after a period of time, you may have some some flare ups. And I guess, you know, I would expect that some time in the fall. Yields have flare ups. Maybe, maybe not. But according to what a lot of people say, you probably will will be able to put them out. You may have some flare ups next year, but eventually it's gonna be God. It's gonna be good. You know, there are some viruses and lose That came and they went for vaccine. They never found the vaccine. They disappeared. I have never shown up again. They died to, like everything else. They die, too. And so whether we do or not, I think great progress is being made by Johnson and Johnson by Oxford and some others, and y you I see is very advanced. But if you don't get it, this is going to go away at some point
